# Gardenz

> Empowering community gardens in New Zealand

## Setup

To get started, clone this repo and then:

```
cd gardenz
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

`IMPORTANT:` Please ask one of the facilitators to give the actual values that should be in the `.env` file.

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Tech used in this Project
- Storybook: is a tool for UI development
- vite: a fast bundler (bye bye webpack)
- leaflet: component to view maps
- visx: to plot graphs
- formik/yup: validating forms
- tailwindcss: utility classes for styling
- playwright: end-to-end testing

## Testing

### Unit/Integration tests

To test an individual test, use **npx**:

```
npx jest events.test.js
```

To run all tests:

```
npm run test
```

To run one single test, add `.only` after `it`

```
it.only('my test name goes here', () => {
  // here test goes here
))

```

Then you can run the test file individually, `npx jest events.test.js`.

### E2E tests

```
npm run test:e2e
```

update the .env file with testing email and password, make sure that this account has been created with Auth0

### Auth0

## Sendgrid

Email notifications are being sent via https://sendgrid.com/ from the address admin@gardenz.eda.nz

In order to change the template log in (as a team member) to Don's/EDA account and select 'Email API' from the side panel and then 'Dynamic templates'

The template is called 'newEvent' and utilises handlebars to display personalised data.

The email template id is also referenced here and currently has the id 'd-5f8909decdc94fa08d818b740e47a025' which needs to be referenced in the notifications.js file (in server/notifications folder).

Within the notifications.js file personalised data is contained within the 'dynamic_template_data' object.

To change the volunteer button in the template, select the button and the url will display on the left hand side of the screen. The url will have to change if testing the volunteer link on localhost or once it has been deployed.

## Libraries used...

## Tailwind CSS

Familarise yourself with Tailwinds Utility first approach: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first

## Formik

For all forms we usea libray called Formik and another called Yup for validation. Pleas read up on the docs! We use the useFormik React hook in most cases. https://formik.org/docs/api/useFormik

## Leaflet

For the Map we use a library called Leaflet! Again please read up in the docs! https://leafletjs.com/
